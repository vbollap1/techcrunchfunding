Project proposal relevant to Data 601 objectives: The proposed data consists of data relates to multiple companies and their funding records in different states/cities with their raised amount. Using this data, I can apply all the objectives of DATA-601 like, reading the CSV file, Cleaning the data, Looping over the file, Visualizing the overall data etc.. I can perform the following operation which includes all the above mentioned Objectives :

I can read the csv and load them to data frames.
I can plot the records of Company Vs State with the funding amount raised.
I can plot the amount raised in different rounds bu summing up all the amounts based on the same rounds. This can be achieved by looping through the data Set.
Does student understand the stories in the data? This data file provides the data of different companies and their raised amount on particular categories in different Staes and cities. My work experience back in India includes, developing requirements for an Insurance Company which has subsidiaries under it. I worked on developing a tool to formulate the incomes, fundings, revenues of the subsidiaries and this is the reason why I selected this data set.
